# UCF-101-Human-Action-Recognition

The purpose of the notebook for **UCF 101** (University of Central Florida 101 dataset) is typically focused on **action recognition** in videos. UCF 101 is a popular dataset used in computer vision and deep learning research to train and evaluate models for recognizing human actions in video clips. The dataset consists of 101 action categories such as "basketball," "running," "clapping," and many others, with video clips taken from various sources like movies, TV shows, and YouTube.

In a notebook using UCF 101, the main goal could be:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading, preprocessing, and augmenting the video data (such as resizing, normalization, and transforming the video frames).
   
2. **Model Training**: Using deep learning models, such as CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), or 3D CNNs to learn the spatial and temporal features from the videos.

3. **Action Classification**: Training models to classify the actions in the UCF 101 videos based on the visual features extracted from the frames.

4. **Evaluation and Performance Metrics**: Testing the model on the dataset, using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate how well the model is recognizing actions.

5. **Application**: Demonstrating how the model can be applied to recognize human actions in new, unseen video data, potentially in real-world applications like surveillance, video tagging, and human-computer interaction.
